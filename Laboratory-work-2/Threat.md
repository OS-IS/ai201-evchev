|     1 - 15    |  Retrieving data from level files                    | Spoofing            | Spoofing of Destination Data Store File System | File System may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of File System. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
|     2 - 16     |  Retrieving data from level files                    | Denial Of Service            | Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Data Processing or File System | Does Data Processing or File System take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
|     3 - 17    |  Saving serialized files to disk                     | Spoofing            | Spoofing of Destination Data Store File System | File System may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of File System. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store. |
|     4 - 18     |  Saving serialized files to disk                     | Information Disclosure            | Weak Access Control for a Resource | Improper data protection of File System can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
|     5 - 19     |  Loading of prepared data from level files           | Elevation Of Privilege            | Elevation Using Impersonation | Data Management may be able to impersonate the context of Data Processing in order to gain additional privilege. |
|     6 - 21    |  Control components update the interface based on the user's actions           | Elevation Of Privilege            | Elevation Using Impersonation | User Interface may be able to impersonate the context of Data Management in order to gain additional privilege. |
|     7 - 26     |  Displaying information           | Repudiation           | External Entity Human User Potentially Denies Receiving Data | Human User claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data. |
|     8 - 27    |  Displaying information           | Denial Of Service           | Data Flow Displaying information Is Potentially Interrupted | An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction. |
|     9 - 29     |  Entering data via the interface          | Spoofing          | Spoofing the User Interface Process | User Interface may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Human User. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process. |
|     10 - 32     |  Entering data via the interface          | Denial Of Service          | Potential Process Crash or Stop for User Interface | User Interface crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric. |
